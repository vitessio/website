---

When Vitess started at YouTube back in 2010, it was designed to work in Google’s Borg. As a result of that interesting bit of history (and the Google origin story), Vitess wound up being one of the earliest adopters of (a) Go and (b) Kubernetes.

At last week’s GoSV meetup (organized by the indefatigable [Aarti](https://twitter.com/classyhacker) and [Conrad](https://twitter.com/conradwt); [join their meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Go-Silicon-Valley/) to get the latest updates on other Go events in Silicon Valley), Vitess co-creator Sugu Sougoumarane shared background stories about Vitess’ origin story, why Go was selected, and how the Vitess and Go team’s backgrounds intertwined during their time at Google.

He also demonstrated VReplication, an upcoming Vitess feature that will benefit anyone who needs materialized views and rollups.

Here’s a [deck](../../files/2019-vitess-gosv.pdf) for you to find out more. 

For a VReplication demo with audio and a transcript, check out [Sugu’s talk at QCon San Francisco 2018](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/vitess) (scroll through to the ‘demo’ section).

For questions about VReplication and how it works, feel free to join the [Vitess community](https://vitess.slack.com) (click [here](https://vitess.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzIxMDMyMzA0NzA1LTBjYjY1M2I2Yjg5YmY3ODIwOTk0N2M1YzI4Y2ViODdiNmIxMDdiMDM5YWQ1ZTc0YmJhZDdiOTliMGVkNDY4MjM) to join).
