That means we've accomplished all our planned overhauls of client APIs
and backward-incompatible protocol changes. See the [release
notes](https://github.com/youtube/vitess/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.1) for
what's new.  
  
We're now working closely with several users who are evaluating Vitess
and providing feedback on the use cases that are important for their
particular applications and production environments. If you're at the
same stage, we welcome you to join the discussion by posting on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vitess).  
  
We're also trying out [Slack](https://vitess.slack.com/) for more
conversational topics. We don't have an automatic invite system in
place, so please email <vitess@googlegroups.com> to request an invite if
you're interested in joining the channel.  
  
Lastly, we're starting our own blog (seeded with our previous guest
posts on other blogs). This will be a place for our engineers to go more
in-depth into various parts of Vitess.  
  
Thanks, and happy scaling everyone!
