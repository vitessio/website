Some of the Vitess maintainers traveled to Brussels, Belgium to attend and speak at pre-FOSDEM MySQL Days and at FOSDEM.

# pre-FOSDEM MySQL Days
When: Feb 2-3  
Who: [Deepthi Sigireddi](https://twitter.com/ATechGirl), [Harshit Gangal](https://twitter.com/harshitgangal), [Shlomi Noach](https://twitter.com/ShlomiNoach)  
What: [VTOrc/Consensus talk](/files/2023-fosdem/Vitess Consensus - FOSDEM.pdf) by Deepthi

# Highlights
- There were a lot of questions about how Vitess handles various failure scenarios.
- We had good conversations with both the MySQL team and MySQL/Vitess community users. There were attendees from booking.com, Slack and HubSpot.
- The event is very interactive. People are very engaged, and it is a great speaking / participation experience.
- People challenge us on how we are doing things. This is a good thing, it forces us to articulate why we do things the way we do not just for others but for ourselves.

# Learnings
- While the Vitess maintainer team keeps track of new developments in MySQL, listening to the Oracle team gives us insight into their priorities.
- This is a unique opportunity to have conversations about MySQL with the Oracle team and power users.
- Vitess is the only generic sharding solution for MySQL. Because of this, the audience was more interested in sharding and how queries work in sharded mode than anything else.

# FOSDEM (MariaDB/MySQL Dev Room)
When: Feb 4-5  
Who: [Deepthi Sigireddi](https://twitter.com/ATechGirl), [Harshit Gangal](https://twitter.com/harshitgangal), [Rohit Nayak](https://twitter.com/rohitnayak), [Shlomi Noach](https://twitter.com/ShlomiNoach) 
What: [Life of a Query](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/life_query_vitess/) talk by Harshit

# Highlights
- Lot of great talks about the ecosystem and MySQL
