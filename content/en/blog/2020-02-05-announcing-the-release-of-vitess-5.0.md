title: 'Announcing the Release of Vitess 5.0'
---

On behalf of the Vitess maintainers team, I am pleased to announce the immediate [release of Vitess 5.0](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v5.20%2B20200204).

Vitess 5.0 is largely a _clean up release_, where we have both deprecated and removed some minor features, and improved both the installation experience and health of the Vitess code-base.

When upgrading from a previous release of Vitess, we recommend reading the [Incompatible Changes](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v5.20%2B20200204) highlighted in the release notes for both 5.0 as well as [Beta 0](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v5.0.0) and [Beta 1](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v5.0.1).
