title: Integration with Orchestrator

[Orchestrator](https://github.com/github/orchestrator) is a tool for managing MySQL replication topologies, including automated failover. It can detect master failure and initiate a recovery in a matter of seconds.

For the most part, Vitess is agnostic to the actions of Orchestrator, which operates below Vitess at the MySQL level. That means you can pretty much [set up Orchestrator](https://github.com/github/orchestrator/wiki/Orchestrator-Manual) in the normal way, with just a few additions as described below.

For the [Kubernetes](../../../get-started/kubernetes) example, we provide a sample script to launch Orchestrator for you with these settings applied.

## Orchestrator configuration

Orchestrator needs to know some things from the Vitess side, like the tablet aliases and whether semisync is enforced with async fallback disabled. We pass this information by telling Orchestrator to execute certain queries that return local metadata from a non-replicated table, as seen in our sample [orchestrator.conf.json](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/docker/orchestrator/orchestrator.conf.json):

``` json
"DetectClusterAliasQuery": "SELECT value FROM _vt.local_metadata WHERE name='ClusterAlias'",
"DetectInstanceAliasQuery": "SELECT value FROM _vt.local_metadata WHERE name='Alias'",
"DetectPromotionRuleQuery": "SELECT value FROM _vt.local_metadata WHERE name='PromotionRule'",
"DetectSemiSyncEnforcedQuery": "SELECT @@global.rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_no_slave AND @@global.rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout > 1000000",
```

Vitess also needs to know the identity of the master for each shard. This is necessary in case of a failover.

It is important to ensure that orchestrator has access to `vtctlclient` so that orchestrator can trigger the change in topology via the [`TabletExternallyReparented`](../../../reference/vtctl/#tabletexternallyreparented) command.

``` json
"PostMasterFailoverProcesses": [
"echo 'Recovered from {failureType} on {failureCluster}. Failed: {failedHost}:{failedPort}; Promoted: {successorHost}:{successorPort}' >> /tmp/recovery.log",
"vtctlclient -server vtctld:15999 TabletExternallyReparented {successorAlias}"
  ],
```

## VTTablet configuration

Normally, you need to seed Orchestrator by giving it the addresses of MySQL instances in each shard. If you have lots of shards, this could be tedious or error-prone.

Luckily, Vitess already knows everything about all the MySQL instances that comprise your cluster. So we provide a mechanism for tablets to self-register with the Orchestrator API, configured by the following vttablet parameters:

* `orc_api_url`: Address of Orchestrator's HTTP API (e.g. http://host:port/api/). Leave empty to disable Orchestrator integration.
* `orc_discover_interval`: How often (e.g. 60s) to ping Orchestrator's HTTP API endpoint to tell it we exist. 0 means never.

Not only does this relieve you from the initial seeding of addresses into Orchestrator, it also means new instances will be discovered immediately, and the topology will automatically repopulate even if Orchestrator's backing store is wiped out. Note that Orchestrator will forget stale instances after a configurable timeout.
