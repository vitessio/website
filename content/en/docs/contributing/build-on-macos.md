The following has been verified to work on __macOS Mojave__. If you are new to Vitess, it is recommended to start with the [local install](../../get-started/local) guide instead.

## Install Dependencies

### Install Xcode

[Install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Install Homebrew and Dependencies

[Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). From here you should be able to install:

```
brew install go automake git curl wget mysql@5.7 etcd
```

Follow the step to add mysql@5.7 to your PATH:
```
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Do not setup MySQL or etcd to restart at login.

### Install Docker

Running the testsuite requires that you [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/). Should you decide to skip this step, you will still be able to compile and run Vitess.

## Build Vitess

Navigate to the directory where you want to download the Vitess source code and clone the Vitess GitHub repo. After doing so, navigate to the `src/vitess.io/vitess` directory.

```
mkdir -p ~/vitess
cd ~/vitess
git clone https://github.com/vitessio/vitess.git \
    src/vitess.io/vitess
cd src/vitess.io/vitess
```

Set environment variables that Vitess will require. It is recommended to put these in your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
# Vitess
export VTROOT=~/vitess
export VTTOP=~/vitess/src/vitess.io/vitess
export VTDATAROOT=~/vitess/vtdataroot
export PATH=${VTROOT}/bin:${PATH}
```

Run `bootstrap.sh` script to download additional dependencies. If your machine requires a proxy to access the Internet, you will need to set the usual environment variables (e.g. `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`):

```
BUILD_PYTHON=0 BUILD_JAVA=0 ./bootstrap.sh
```

This may result in a warning about `$GOROOT` and an unsupported architecture. It is safe to ignore these errors for now:

```
morgans-mini:vitess morgo$ BUILD_PYTHON=0 BUILD_JAVA=0 ./bootstrap.sh
WARNING: $GOROOT may not be compatible with the used go binary
Please make sure 'go' comes from $GOROOT/bin
go_env: /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.12.6/libexec
go_bin: /usr/local/bin/go
creating git hooks
installing protoc 3.6.1
ERROR: unsupported architecture
```

Build Vitess:

```
source ./dev.env
make build
```

## Testing your Binaries

Run the included local example:

```
cd examples/local
./101_initial_cluster.sh
```

You should see the following:
```
$ ./101_initial_cluster.sh 
morgans-mini:local morgo$ ./101_initial_cluster.sh 
enter etcd2 env
add /vitess/global
add /vitess/zone1
add zone1 CellInfo

{
  "tables": {

    },

}
If this is not what you expected, check the input data (as JSON parsing will skip unexpected fields).
enter etcd2 env

```

You can continue the remaining parts of this example by following the [local](../../get-started/local) get started guide.

### Full testsuite

To run the testsuite in Docker:

```
make docker_test flavor=mysql57
```

Running the full suite currently takes 2+ hours to complete.

### Key Already Exists

This error is because etcd was not cleaned up from the previous run of the example. You can manually fix this by running `./401_teardown.sh` and then start again:
```
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/zone1) [6]
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/global) [6]
```

### Python Errors

The end-to-end test suite currently requires Python 2.7. We are working on removing this dependency, but in the mean time you can run tests from within Docker. The MySQL 5.7 container provided includes the required dependencies:

```
make docker_test flavor=mysql57
```

### No .installed_version file

This error indicates that you have not put the required vitess environment variables in your `.bashrc` file:

```
enter etcd2 env
cat: /dist/etcd/.installed_version: No such file or directory
```

Make sure the following variables are defined:
```
export VTROOT=~/vitess
export VTTOP=~/vitess/src/vitess.io/vitess
export VTDATAROOT=~/vitess/vtdataroot
export PATH=${VTROOT}/bin:${PATH}
```

### Cannot create dir /etcd

This indicates that the environment variable `VTDATAROOT` is not defined, and you have not put the required vitess environment variables in your `.bashrc` file:

```
./101_initial_cluster.sh
enter etcd2 env
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/etcd’: Permission denied
```

Make sure the following variables are defined:
```
export VTROOT=~/vitess
export VTTOP=~/vitess/src/vitess.io/vitess
export VTDATAROOT=~/vitess/vtdataroot
export PATH=${VTROOT}/bin:${PATH}
```
