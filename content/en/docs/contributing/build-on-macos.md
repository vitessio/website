The following has been verified to work on __macOS Mojave__. If you are new to Vitess, it is recommended to start with the [local install](../../get-started/local) guide instead.

## Install Dependencies

### Install Xcode

[Install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Install Homebrew and Dependencies

[Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). From here you should be able to install:

```shell
brew install go@1.13 automake git curl wget mysql@5.7 etcd
```

Add `mysql@5.7` and `go@1.13` to your `PATH`:

```shell
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/go@1.13/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Do not setup MySQL or etcd to restart at login.

## Build Vitess

Navigate to the directory where you want to download the Vitess source code and clone the Vitess GitHub repo:

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/vitessio/vitess.git
cd vitess
```

Set environment variables that Vitess will require. It is recommended to put these in your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
# Vitess binaries
export PATH=~/vitess/bin:${PATH}
```

Build Vitess:

```shell
make build
```

## Testing your Binaries

The unit tests require that you first install a Java runtime. This is required for running ZooKeeper tests:

```shell
brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
brew cask info java
```

You will also need to install `ant` and `maven`:

```shell
brew install ant maven
```

You can then install additional components from `make tools`. If your machine requires a proxy to access the Internet, you will need to set the usual environment variables (e.g. `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`) first:

```shell
make tools
make unit_test
```

In addition to running tests, you can try running the [local example](../../get-started/local).

## Common Build Issues

### Key Already Exists

This error is because etcd was not cleaned up from the previous run of the example. You can manually fix this by running `./401_teardown.sh`, removing vtdataroot and then starting again:
```
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/zone1) [6]
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/global) [6]
```
