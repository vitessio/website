The following has been verified to work on __Ubuntu 19.10__ and __Debian 10__. If you are new to Vitess, it is recommended to start with the [local install](../../get-started/local) guide instead.

## Install Dependencies

### Install Go

[Download and install](http://golang.org/doc/install) Golang. Vitess is tested and shipped using a specific Golang version for each release.
For maximum compatibility we encourage you to use the same Golang version as [the one mentioned in our `build.env` file](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/build.env#L20).

### Install Node 16.13.0+

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Ensure the following is in your bashrc/zshrc or similar:
```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

Finally, install [node](https://nodejs.org/):

```
nvm install --lts 16.13.0
nvm use 16.13.0
```

See the [vtadmin README](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/web/vtadmin/README.md) for more details.
### Packages from apt repos

Install dependencies required to build and run Vitess:

```
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-client make unzip g++ etcd curl git wget

# Debian
sudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-server default-mysql-client make unzip g++ etcd curl wget
```

The services `mysqld` and `etcd` should be shutdown, since `etcd` will conflict with the `etcd` started in the examples, and `mysqlctl` will start its own copies of `mysqld`:

```
sudo service mysql stop
sudo service etcd stop
sudo systemctl disable mysql
sudo systemctl disable etcd
```

**Notes:**

* We will be using etcd as the topology service. The command `make tools` can also install Zookeeper or Consul for you, which requires additional dependencies.

### Disable mysqld AppArmor Profile

The `mysqld` AppArmor profile will not allow Vitess to launch MySQL in any data directory by default. You will need to disable it:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld /etc/apparmor.d/disable/
sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld
```

The following command should return an empty result:

```
sudo aa-status | grep mysqld
```

## Build Vitess

Navigate to the directory where you want to download the Vitess source code and clone the Vitess GitHub repo:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/vitessio/vitess.git
cd vitess
```

Set environment variables that Vitess will require. It is recommended to put these in your `.bashrc`:

```
# Additions to ~/.bashrc file

#VTDATAROOT
export VTDATAROOT=/tmp/vtdataroot

# Vitess binaries
export PATH=~/vitess/bin:${PATH}
```

Build Vitess:

```
make build
```

Since the addition of [#13263](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/13262) the `vtadmin` React application will be built when doing a `make build`.
You can skip this step by setting the `NOVTADMINBUILD` environment variable.
```shell
NOVTADMINBUILD=1 make build
```

## Testing your Binaries

The unit test requires that you first install the following packages:

```
sudo apt-get install -y ant maven default-jdk zip
```

You can then install additional components from `make tools`. If your machine requires a proxy to access the Internet, you will need to set the usual environment variables (e.g. `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`) first:

```
make tools
make unit_test
```

In addition to running tests, you can try running the [local example](../../get-started/local).


## Common Build Issues

### Key Already Exists

This error is because etcd was not cleaned up from the previous run of the example. You can manually fix this by running `./401_teardown.sh`, removing vtdataroot and then starting again:
```
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/zone1) [6]
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/global) [6]
```

### MySQL Fails to Initialize

This error is most likely the result of an AppArmor enforcing profile being present:

```
1027 18:28:23.462926   19486 mysqld.go:734] mysqld --initialize-insecure failed: /usr/sbin/mysqld: exit status 1, output: mysqld: [ERROR] Failed to open required defaults file: /home/morgo/vitess/vtdataroot/vt_0000000102/my.cnf
mysqld: [ERROR] Fatal error in defaults handling. Program aborted!

could not stat mysql error log (/home/morgo/vitess/vtdataroot/vt_0000000102/error.log): stat /home/morgo/vitess/vtdataroot/vt_0000000102/error.log: no such file or directory
E1027 18:28:23.464117   19486 mysqlctl.go:254] failed init mysql: /usr/sbin/mysqld: exit status 1, output: mysqld: [ERROR] Failed to open required defaults file: /home/morgo/vitess/vtdataroot/vt_0000000102/my.cnf
mysqld: [ERROR] Fatal error in defaults handling. Program aborted!
E1027 18:28:23.464780   19483 mysqld.go:734] mysqld --initialize-insecure failed: /usr/sbin/mysqld: exit status 1, output: mysqld: [ERROR] Failed to open required defaults file: /home/morgo/vitess/vtdataroot/vt_0000000101/my.cnf
mysqld: [ERROR] Fatal error in defaults handling. Program aborted!
```

The following command disables the AppArmor profile for `mysqld`:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld /etc/apparmor.d/disable/
sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld
```

The following command should now return an empty result:
```
sudo aa-status | grep mysqld
```

If this doesn't work, you can try making sure all lurking processes are shutdown, and then restart the example again in the `/tmp` directory:

```
for process in `pgrep -f '(vtdataroot|VTDATAROOT)'`; do 
 kill -9 $process
done;

export VTDATAROOT=/tmp/vtdataroot
./101_initial_cluster.sh
```

### Mysqlctl Fails to Start 
This error is because some tests need `VTROOT`, but it is missing. You can manually run `source dev.env` to solve this:
```
Running tool: /usr/local/go/bin/go test -timeout 30s -run ^TestFloatFormatting$ vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/vtgate/evalengine/integration

E0316 20:47:00.173050   63268 local_cluster.go:313] Mysqlctl failed to start: fork/exec bin/mysqlctl: no such file or directory
could not launch mysql: fork/exec bin/mysqlctl: no such file or directory
FAIL    vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/vtgate/evalengine/integration    0.018s
```
If you use an IDE to run these tests, you need to set `VTROOT` previously. For example, in VScode
```
"go.testEnvVars": {
    "VTROOT": "<path to my vitess checkout>"
}
```
