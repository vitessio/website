## VSchemas describe how to shard data

VSchema stands for Vitess Schema. In contrast to a traditional database schema that contains metadata about tables, a VSchema contains metadata about how tables are organized across [keyspaces](../keyspace) and [shards](../shard). It contains the information needed to make Vitess look like a single database server.

The VSchema contains information about the [Vindex](../vindex) for a sharded table. When the application issues a query with a `WHERE` clause that references the key, Vitess uses the Vindex that the VSchema specifies for that table to route the query to the appropriate shard.

## Sharded keyspaces require a VSchema

A VSchema is needed to tie together all the databases that Vitess manages. For a very trivial setup where there is only one unsharded keyspace, there is no need to specify a VSchema because Vitess will know that there is no other place to route a query.

If you have multiple unsharded keyspaces, you can still avoid defining a VSchema in one of two ways:

1. Connect to a keyspace and all queries are sent to it.
2. Connect to Vitess without specifying a keyspace, but use qualified names for tables, like `keyspace.table` in your queries.

However, once the setup exceeds the above complexity, VSchemas become a necessity. Vitess has a [working demo](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/examples/demo) of VSchemas.

## Sharding Model

In Vitess, a [`keyspace`](../concepts/keyspace) is sharded by [`keyspace ID`](../concepts/keyspace-id) ranges. Each row in a sharded table is assigned a keyspace ID, which determines the shard where the contents of that row is stored. Mapping to a `keyspace ID`, and then to a shard, gives Vitess the flexibility to reshard the data with minimal disruption, because the `keyspace ID` of each row remains unchanged through the process.

The `keyspace ID` is a concept that is internal to Vitess. The application does not need to know anything about it. There is no physical column that stores the actual `keyspace ID`. Vitess computes the keyspace value using a [Vindex](#vindexes).

 The `keyspace ID` is similar to a NoSQL sharding key. 
This difference is significant enough that we do not refer to the keyspace ID as the sharding key. A [Primary Vindex](../vindexes/#the-primary-vindex) more closely resembles the NoSQL sharding key.



## Vindexes

The Vschema contains the [Vindex](../vindexes) for any sharded tables. The Vindex tells Vitess where to find the shard that contains a particular row for a sharded table. Every VSchema must have at least one Vindex, called the [Primary Vindex](../vindexes/#the-primary-vindex), defined. The Primary Vindex is unique: given an input value, it produces a single keyspace ID, or value in the keyspace used to shard the table. The Primary Vindex is typically a functional Vindex: Vitess computes the keyspace ID as needed from a column in the sharded table.

## Sequences

Auto-increment columns do not work very well for sharded tables. [Vitess sequences](../reference/vitess-sequences) solve this problem. Sequence tables must be specified in the VSchema, and then tied to table columns. At the time of insert, if no value is specified for such a column, VTGate will generate a number for it using the sequence table.

## Reference tables

Vitess allows you to create an unsharded table and deploy it into all shards of a sharded keyspace. The data in such a table is assumed to be identical for all shards. In this case, you can specify that the table is of type `reference`, and should not specify any vindex for it. Any joins of this table with an unsharded table will be treated as a local join.

Typically, such a table has a canonical source in an unsharded keyspace, and the copies in the sharded keyspace are kept up-to-date through VReplication.

## Configuration

The configuration of your VSchema reflects the desired sharding configuration for your database, including whether or not your tables are sharded and whether you want to implement a secondary Vindex. 

### Unsharded Table

The following snippets show the necessary configs for creating a table in an unsharded keyspace:

Schema:

``` sql
# lookup keyspace
create table name_user_idx(name varchar(128), user_id bigint, primary key(name, user_id));
```

VSchema:

``` json
// lookup keyspace
{
  "sharded": false,
  "tables": {
    "name_user_idx": {}
  }
}
```

For a normal unsharded table, the VSchema only needs to know the table name. No additional metadata is needed.

### Sharded Table With Simple Primary Vindex

To create a sharded table with a simple [Primary Vindex](../vindexes/#the-primary-vindex), the VSchema requires more information:

Schema:

``` sql
# user keyspace
create table user(user_id bigint, name varchar(128), primary key(user_id));
```

VSchema:

``` json
// user keyspace
{
  "sharded": true,
  "vindexes": {
    "hash": {
      "type": "hash"
    }
  },
  "tables": {
    "user": {
      "column_vindexes": [
        {
          "column": "user_id",
          "name": "hash"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Because Vindexes can be shared, the JSON requires them to be specified in a separate `vindexes` section, and then referenced by name from the `tables` section. The VSchema above simply states that `user_id` uses `hash` as Primary Vindex. The first Vindex of every table must be the Primary Vindex.

### Specifying A Sequence

Since user is a sharded table, it will be beneficial to tie it to a Sequence. However, the sequence must be defined in the lookup (unsharded) keyspace. It is then referred from the user (sharded) keyspace. In this example, we are designating the `user_id` (Primary Vindex) column as the auto-increment.

Schema:

``` sql
# lookup keyspace
create table user_seq(id int, next_id bigint, cache bigint, primary key(id)) comment 'vitess_sequence';
insert into user_seq(id, next_id, cache) values(0, 1, 3);
```

For the sequence table, `id` is always 0. `next_id` starts off as 1, and the cache is usually a medium-sized number like 1000. In our example, we are using a small number to showcase how it works.

VSchema:

``` json
// lookup keyspace
{
  "sharded": false,
  "tables": {
    "user_seq": {
      "type": "sequence"
    }
  }
}

// user keyspace
{
  "sharded": true,
  "vindexes": {
    "hash": {
      "type": "hash"
    }
  },
  "tables": {
    "user": {
      "column_vindexes": [
        {
          "column": "user_id",
          "name": "hash"
        }
      ],
      "auto_increment": {
        "column": "user_id",
        "sequence": "user_seq"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Specifying A Secondary Vindex

The following snippet shows how to configure a [Secondary Vindex](../vindexes/#secondary-vindexes) that is backed by a lookup table. In this case, the lookup table is configured to be in the unsharded lookup keyspace:

Schema:

``` sql
# lookup keyspace
create table name_user_idx(name varchar(128), user_id bigint, primary key(name, user_id));
```

VSchema:

``` json
// lookup keyspace
{
  "sharded": false,
  "tables": {
    "name_user_idx": {}
  }
}

// user keyspace
{
  "sharded": true,
  "vindexes": {
    "name_user_idx": {
      "type": "lookup_hash",
      "params": {
        "table": "name_user_idx",
        "from": "name",
        "to": "user_id"
      },
      "owner": "user"
    }
  },
  "tables": {
    "user": {
      "column_vindexes": [
        {
          "column": "name",
          "name": "name_user_idx"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To recap, a checklist for creating the shared Secondary Vindex is:

* Create physical `name_user_idx` table in lookup database.
* Define a routing for it in the lookup VSchema.
* Define a Vindex as type `lookup_hash` that points to it. Ensure that the `params` match the table name and columns.
* Define the owner for the Vindex as the `user` table.
* Specify that `name` uses the Vindex.

Currently, these steps have to be currently performed manually. However, extended DDLs backed by improved automation will simplify these tasks in the future.

### Advanced usage

The examples/demo also shows more tricks you can perform:

* The `music` table uses a secondary lookup vindex `music_user_idx`. However, this lookup vindex is itself a sharded table.
* `music_extra` shares `music_user_idx` with `music`, and uses it as Primary Vindex.
* `music_extra` defines an additional Functional Vindex called `keyspace_id` which the demo auto-populates using the reverse mapping capability.
* There is also a `name_info` table that showcases a case-insensitive Vindex `unicode_loose_md5`.
