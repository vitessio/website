The following `vtctl` commands are available for administering shards.

## Commands

### CreateShard

Creates the specified shard.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">CreateShard -- [--force] [--parent] &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

#### Flags

| Name | Type | Definition |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| force | Boolean | Proceeds with the command even if the keyspace already exists |
| parent | Boolean | Creates the parent keyspace if it doesn't already exist |


#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables as well as the shard associated with the command. The keyspace must be identified by a string that does not contain whitespace, while the shard is typically identified by a string in the format <code>&lt;range start&gt;-&lt;range end&gt;</code>.

#### Errors

* the <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> argument is required for the <code>&lt;CreateShard&gt;</code> command This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly one argument.

### GetShard

Outputs a JSON structure that contains information about the Shard.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">GetShard &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables as well as the shard associated with the command. The keyspace must be identified by a string that does not contain whitespace, while the shard is typically identified by a string in the format <code>&lt;range start&gt;-&lt;range end&gt;</code>.

#### Errors

* the <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> argument is required for the <code>&lt;GetShard&gt;</code> command This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly one argument.

### ValidateShard

Validates that all nodes that are reachable from this shard are consistent.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">ValidateShard -- [--ping-tablets] &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

#### Flags

| Name | Type | Definition |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| ping-tablets | Boolean | Indicates whether all tablets should be pinged during the validation process |


#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables as well as the shard associated with the command. The keyspace must be identified by a string that does not contain whitespace, while the shard is typically identified by a string in the format <code>&lt;range start&gt;-&lt;range end&gt;</code>.

#### Errors

* the <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> argument is required for the <code>&lt;ValidateShard&gt;</code> command This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly one argument.

### ShardReplicationPositions

Shows the replication status of each replica machine in the shard graph. In this case, the status refers to the replication lag between the primary vttablet and the replica vttablet. In Vitess, data is always written to the primary vttablet first and then replicated to all replica vttablets. Output is sorted by tablet type, then replication position. Use ctrl-C to interrupt command and see partial result if needed.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">ShardReplicationPositions &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables as well as the shard associated with the command. The keyspace must be identified by a string that does not contain whitespace, while the shard is typically identified by a string in the format <code>&lt;range start&gt;-&lt;range end&gt;</code>.

#### Errors

* the <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> argument is required for the <code>&lt;ShardReplicationPositions&gt;</code> command This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly one argument.


### ListShardTablets

Lists all tablets in the specified shard.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">ListShardTablets &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables as well as the shard associated with the command. The keyspace must be identified by a string that does not contain whitespace, while the shard is typically identified by a string in the format <code>&lt;range start&gt;-&lt;range end&gt;</code>.

#### Errors

* the <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> argument is required for the <code>&lt;ListShardTablets&gt;</code> command This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly one argument.

### SetShardIsPrimaryServing

```
SetShardIsPrimaryServing <keyspace/shard> <is_serving>
```

### SetShardTabletControl

Sets the shardTabletControls or the tabletControls records for a shard and tablet type in the topology service. Only use this for an emergency fix or after a corrupted MoveTables action. Always specify the `denied_tables` flag for MoveTables, but never for Reshard operations.

To set the `queryServiceDisabled` for the tablet, set `disable_query_service` to true; to unset the queryServiceDisabled provide `denied_tables` with an empty table set. Useful to fix vReplication operations gone wrong. These specific flags update the values for `shardTabletControls` in the topology path: `/keyspaces/<keyspace>/SrvKeyspace`.

{{< warning >}}
It is important to note here the queryServiceDisabled can not be removed by `disable_query_service=false` or the `remove` flags. Only `denied_tables=""` will remove this setting.
{{< /warning >}}

To change the `deniedTables` list, specify the `denied_tables` parameter with the new list, this is useful to fix tables that are being errantly blocked. To remove the tabletControls for selected tables, use the `remove` flag. These specific flags update the values for `tabletControls` in the topology path: `/keyspaces/<keyspace>/shards/<shard>/Shard`.

The `SetShardTabletControl` only updates the topology records for a given shard and type, you still need to run [RefreshStateByShard](../tablets#refreshstatebyshard) to inform the vttablets of the topology change.

#### Examples

<pre class="command-example">SetShardTabletControl -- [--cells=c1,c2,...] [--denied_tables=t1,t2,...] [--remove] [--disable_query_service] &lt;keyspace/shard&gt; &lt;tablet type&gt;</pre>

**Disable serving of the listed tables for the selected keyspace/shard and tablet type:**

<pre class="command-example">SetShardTabletControl -- [--denied_tables=t1,t2,...] &lt;keyspace/shard&gt; &lt;tablet type&gt;<br>
RefreshStateByShard &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

**Serve all tables for the selected keyspace/shard and tablet type:**

<pre class="command-example">SetShardTabletControl -- --remove &lt;keyspace/shard&gt; &lt;tablet type&gt;<br>
RefreshStateByShard &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

**Disable serving for the selected keyspace/shard and tablet type:**

<pre class="command-example">SetShardTabletControl -- --disable_query_service=true &lt;keyspace/shard&gt; &lt;tablet type&gt;<br>
RefreshStateByShard &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

**Enable serving for the selected keyspace/shard and tablet type:**

<pre class="command-example">SetShardTabletControl -- --denied_tables="" &lt;keyspace/shard&gt; &lt;tablet type&gt;<br>
RefreshStateByShard &lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</pre>

| disable_query_service | Boolean | Disables query service on the provided nodes. This flag requires 'denied_tables' and 'remove' to be unset, otherwise it's ignored.                                      |
| remove | Boolean | Removes cells for MoveTables.                                                                                                                                           |


#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables as well as the shard associated with the command.

### InitShardPrimary

This command has been deprecated. Please use PlannedReparentShard instead.

Sets the initial primary for a shard. Will make all other tablets in the shard replicas of the provided primary. WARNING: this could cause data loss on an already replicating shard.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">InitShardPrimary -- [--force] [--wait_replicas_timeout=&lt;duration&gt;] &lt;keyspace/shard&gt; &lt;tablet alias&gt;</pre>

#### Flags

| Name | Type | Definition |

* active reparent commands disabled (unset the --disable_active_reparents flag to enable)

### PlannedReparentShard

Reparents the shard to a new primary that can either be explicitly specified,
or chosen by Vitess.  Both the existing primary and new primary need to be up
and running to use this command. If the existing primary for the shard is
down, you should use [EmergencyReparentShard](#emergencyreparentshard) instead.

If the `new_primary` flag is not provided, Vitess will try to automatically
choose a replica to promote to primary, avoiding any replicas specified in
the `avoid_tablet` flag, if provided.  Note that Vitess **will not consider
any replicas outside the cell the current primary is in for promotion**,
therefore you **must** pass the `new_primary` flag if you need to promote
a replica in a different cell from the primary.  In the automated selection
mode Vitess will prefer the most advanced replica for promotion, to minimize
failover time.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">PlannedReparentShard -- --keyspace_shard=&lt;keyspace/shard&gt; [--new_primary=&lt;tablet alias&gt;] [--avoid_tablet=&lt;tablet alias&gt;]</pre>

#### Flags

| Name | Type | Definition |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| avoid_tablet | string | alias of a tablet that should not be the primary, i.e. reparent to any replica other than this one |
| keyspace_shard | string | keyspace/shard of the shard that needs to be reparented |
| new_primary | string | alias of a tablet that should be the new primary |
| wait_replicas_timeout | Duration | time to wait for replicas to catch up in reparenting |


#### Errors

* action <code>&lt;PlannedReparentShard&gt;</code> requires --keyspace_shard=<code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> [--new_primary=<code>&lt;tablet alias&gt;</code>] [--avoid_tablet=<code>&lt;tablet alias&gt;</code>] This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly 0 arguments.
* active reparent commands disabled (unset the --disable_active_reparents flag to enable)
* cannot use legacy syntax and flags --<code>&lt;keyspace_shard&gt;</code> and --<code>&lt;new_primary&gt;</code> for action <code>&lt;PlannedReparentShard&gt;</code> at the same time

### EmergencyReparentShard

Reparents the shard to the new primary. Assumes the old primary is dead and not responding.

#### Errors

* action <code>&lt;EmergencyReparentShard&gt;</code> requires --keyspace_shard=<code>&lt;keyspace/shard&gt;</code> --new_primary=<code>&lt;tablet alias&gt;</code> This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly 0 arguments.
* active reparent commands disabled (unset the --disable_active_reparents flag to enable)
* cannot use legacy syntax and flag --<code>&lt;new_primary&gt;</code> for action <code>&lt;EmergencyReparentShard&gt;</code> at the same time

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">TabletExternallyReparented &lt;tablet alias&gt;</pre>

#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;tablet alias&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. A Tablet Alias uniquely identifies a vttablet to promote to primary. The argument value is in the format <code>&lt;cell name&gt;-&lt;uid&gt;</code>.

#### Errors

* the <code>&lt;tablet alias&gt;</code> argument is required for the <code>&lt;TabletExternallyReparented&gt;</code> command This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly one argument.
