Backup and restore operations export several metrics using the expvars interface. These are available at the `/debug/vars` endpoint of Vtbackup's and VTTablet's http status pages. [More details can be found here](../../features/monitoring/#3-push-based-metrics-system).

## Backup metrics

Metrics related to backup operations are available in both Vtbackup and VTTablet.

#### BackupBytes, BackupCount, BackupDurationNanoseconds

Depending on the Backup Engine and Backup Storage in-use, a backup may be a complex pipeline of operations, including but not limited to:

 * Reading files from disk.
 * Compressing files.
 * Uploading compress files to cloud object storage.

These operations are counted and timed, and the number of bytes consumed or produced by each stage of the pipeline are counted as well.

## Restore metrics

Metrics related to restore operations are available in both Vtbackup and VTTablet.

#### RestoreBytes, RestoreCount, RestoreDurationNanoseconds

Depending on the Backup Engine and Backup Storage in-use, a restore may be a complex pipeline of operations, including but not limited to:

 * Downloading compressed files from cloud object storage.
 * Decompressing files.
 * Writing decompressed files to disk.

These operations are counted and timed, and the number of bytes consumed or produced by each stage of the pipeline are counted as well.

#### RestoredBackupTime, RestorePosition

_RestoredBackupTime_ captures the timestamp associated with the backup from which the current process was restored. _RestorePosition_ captures the GTID position associated with that backup.

## Vtbackup metrics

Vtbackup exports some metrics which are not available elsewhere.

#### DurationByPhaseSeconds

Vtbackup fetches the last backup, restores it to an empty mysql installation, replicates recent changes into that installation, and then takes a backup of that installation.

_DurationByPhaseSeconds_ exports timings for these individual phases.

Some notes to help understand these metrics:

 * `BackupBytes["BackupStorage.File.File:Write"]` measures how many bytes were read from disk by the `file` Backup Storage implementation during the backup phase.
 * `DurationByPhaseSeconds["CatchUpReplication"]` measures how long it took to catch-up replication after the restore phase.
 * `DurationByPhaseSeconds["RestoreLastBackup"]` measures to the duration of the restore phase.
 * `RestoreDurationNanoseconds["-.-.Restore"]` also measures to the duration of the restore phase.
