##### _Experimental_

This documentation is for a new (v2) set of vtctld commands. See [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/7225) for more details.

### Command

```
MoveTables/Reshard Show <targetKs.workflow>
```

### Description

`Show` displays useful information about a workflow. (At this time the [Workflow](../../workflow) Show command gives more information. This will be improved over time.)
