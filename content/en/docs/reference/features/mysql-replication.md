{{< warning >}}
Vitess requires the use of Row-Based Replication with GTIDs enabled. In addition, Vitess only supports the default `binlog_row_image` of `FULL`.
{{< /warning >}}

Vitess makes use of MySQL Replication for both high availability and to receive a feed of changes to database tables. This feed is then used in features such as [VReplication](./vreplication), and to identify schema changes so that caches can be updated.

## Semi-Sync

Vitess strongly recommends the use of Semi-synchronous replication for High Availability. When enabled in Vitess, _semi-sync_ has the following characteristics:

* The master will only accept writes if it has at least one replica connected, and configured correctly to send semi-sync ACKs. Vitess configures the semi-sync timeout to essentially an unlimited number so that it will never fallback to asyncronous replication. This is important to prevent split brain (or alternate futures) in case of a network partition. If we can verify all replicas have stopped replicating, we know the old master is not accepting writes, even if we are unable to contact the old master itself.

* Tablets of type rdonly will not send semi-sync ACKs. This is intentional because rdonly tablets are not eligible to be promoted to master, so Vitess avoids the case where a rdonly tablet is the single best candidate for election at the time of master failure.

These behaviors combine to give you the property that, in case of master failure, there is at least one other replica that has every transaction that was ever reported to clients as having completed. You can then ([manually](../../programs/vtctl/#emergencyreparentshard), or [using Orchestrator](../../../user-guides/configuration-advanced/integration-with-orchestrator/) to pick the replica that is farthest ahead in GTID position and promote that to be the new master.

Thus, you can survive sudden master failure without losing any transactions that were reported to clients as completed. In MySQL 5.7+, this guarantee is strengthened slightly to preventing loss of any transactions that were ever **committed** on the original master, eliminating so-called [phantom reads](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=62174).

On the other hand these behaviors also give a requirement that each shard must have at least 2 tablets with type *replica* (with addition of the master that can be demoted to type *replica* this gives a minimum of 3 tablets with initial type *replica*). This will allow for the master to have a semi-sync acker when one of the replica tablets is down for any reason (for a version update, machine reboot, schema swap or anything else).

With regard to replication lag, note that this does **not** guarantee there is always at least one replica from which queries will always return up-to-date results. Semi-sync guarantees that at least one replica has the transaction in its relay log, but it has not necessarily been applied yet. The only way Vitess guarantees a fully up-to-date read is to send the request to the master.

## Database Schema Considerations

* Row-based replication requires that replicas have the same schema as the master, and corruption will likely occur if the column order does not match. Earlier versions of Vitess which used Statement-Based replication recommended applying schema changes on replicas first, and then swapping their role to master. This method is no longer recommended and a tool such as [`gh-ost`](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) or [`pt-online-schema-change`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html) should be used instead.

* Using a column of type `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE` as part of a Primary Key is not supported. This limitation is because Vitess may try to execute a query for a value (for example 2.2) which MySQL will return zero results, even when the approximate value is present.

* It is not recommended to change the schema at the same time a resharding operation is being performed. This limitation exists because interpreting RBR events requires accurate knowledge of the table's schema, and Vitess does not always correctly handle the case that the schema has changed.
