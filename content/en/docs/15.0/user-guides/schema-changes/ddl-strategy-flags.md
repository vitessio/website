[`ddl_strategy`](../ddl-strategies) accepts flags in command line format. The flags can be vitess-specific, or, if unrecognized by Vitess, are passed on the underlying online schema change tools.

## Vitess flags

Vitess respects the following flags. They can be combined unless specifically indicated otherwise:

- `--allow-concurrent`: allow a migration to run concurrently to other migrations, rather than queue sequentially. Some restrictions apply, see [concurrent migrations](../concurrent-migrations).
- `--allow-zero-in-date`: normally Vitess operates with a strict `sql_mode`. If you have columns such as `my_datetime DATETIME DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00'` and you wish to run DDL on these tables, Vitess will prevent the migration due to invalid values. Provide `--allow-zero-in-date` to allow either a fully zero-date or a zero-in-date inyour schema. See also [NO_ZERO_IN_DATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date) and [NO_ZERO_DATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_date) documentation for [sql_mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html).

- `--declarative`: mark the migration as declarative. You will define a desired schema state by supplying `CREATE` and `DROP` statements, ad Vitess will infer how to achieve the desired schema. If need be, it will generate an `ALTER` migration to convert to the new schema. See [declarative migrations](../declarative-migrations).

- `--postpone-completion`: initiate a migration that will only cut-over per user command, i.e. will not auto-complete. This gives the user control over the time when the schema change takes effect. See [postponed migrations](../postponed-migrations).

  `--declarative` migrations are only evaluated when scheduled to run. If a migrations is both `--declarative` and `--postpone-completion` then it will remain in `queued` state until the user issues a `ALTER VITESS_MIGRATION ... COMPLETE`. If it turns out that Vitess should run the migration as an `ALTER` then it is only at that time that the migration starts.

- `--postpone-launch`: initiate a migration that remains `queued` and only launches per user command. See [postponed migrations](../postponed-migrations).

- `--singleton`: only allow a single pending migration to be submitted at a time. From the moment the migration is queued, and until either completion, failure or cancellation, no other new `--singleton` migration can be submitted. New requests will be rejected with error. `--singleton` works as a an exclusive lock for pending migrations. Note that this only affects migrations with `--singleton` flag. Migrations running without that flag are unaffected and unblocked.

- `--singleton-context`: only allow migrations submitted under same _context_ to be pending at any given time. Migrations submitted with a different _context_ are rejected for as long as at least one of the initially submitted migrations is pending.

  It does not make sense to combine `--singleton` and `--singleton-context`.

## Pass-through flags

Flags unrecognized by Vitess are passed on to the underlying schema change tools. For example, a `gh-ost` migration can run with:
```sql
set @@ddl_strategy='gh-ost --max-load Threads_running=200'
```
Since Vitess knows nothing about `--max-load` it will pass it on as a command line argument to `gh-ost`. Consult [gh-ost documentation](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) for supported command line flags.

Similarly, a `pt-online-schema-change` migration can run with:
```sql
set @@ddl_strategy='pt-osc --null-to-not-null'
```
Consult [pt-online-schema-change documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/3.0/pt-online-schema-change.html) for supported command line flags.

The `vitess` strategy (formerly known as `online`) uses Vitess internal mechanisms and is not a standalone command line tool. therefore, it has no particular command line flags. For internal testing/CI purposes, the `vitess` strategy supports `--vreplication-test-suite`, and this flag must **not** be used in production as it can have destructive consequences.
