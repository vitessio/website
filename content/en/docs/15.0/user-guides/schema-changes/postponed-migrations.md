Postponed migrations allow:

- Postponing the launch of a migration, and/or
- Postponing the final cut-over/completion of a migration.

In both cases, it takes an explicit user interaction to launch or to complete the migration.

Normally, migrations are executed by Vitess and are launched and completed automatically. For example, an `ALTER` on a large table can take hours or more to complete. Vitess automatically instates the new schema in place whenever it is satisfied that the `ALTER` is complete. Or, a `DROP` statement could wait in queue while other statements are running, only to actually execute hours later.

## Postpone launch

A postponed-launch migration will remain in queued state and will not start executing, until instructed to launch.

Add `--postpone-launch` to any of the online DDL strategies. Example:

```sql

mysql> set @@ddl_strategy='vitess --postpone-launch';

-- The migration is tracked, but the ALTER process won't start running.
mysql> alter table mytable add column i int not null;
+--------------------------------------+
| uuid                                 |
+--------------------------------------+
| 9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3 |
+--------------------------------------+
```

Migrations executed with `--postpone-launch` are visible on `show vitess_migrations` just as normal. They will present as `queued`. The column `postpone_launch` indicates that the migration will not auto-start:


```sql
mysql> show vitess_migrations like '9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                             id: 3
                 migration_uuid: 9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3
                       keyspace: commerce
                          shard: 0
                   mysql_schema: vt_commerce
                    mysql_table: mytable
            migration_statement: alter table mytable add column i int not null
                       strategy: vitess
                        options: --postpone-launch
                added_timestamp: 2022-09-21 06:28:34
            requested_timestamp: 2022-09-21 06:28:34
                ready_timestamp: NULL
              started_timestamp: NULL
             liveness_timestamp: NULL
            completed_timestamp: NULL
              cleanup_timestamp: NULL
               migration_status: queued
                            ...
                postpone_launch: 1
```

### Use case

The use case is specific to multi sharded environments. In some cases, a user may wish to experiment a migration on a single shard:

- To see how long it takes to run.
- To see what impact it has on production traffic.
- To see what impact the schema change has.

Postponed launch migrations make it possible to launch a migration on specific shards, while the migration remains `queued` on the rest of the shards.

{{< warning >}}
Completing a migration on a subset of the shards means different shards will have different schemas. Do not do this when adding/removing columns, because the table on affected shards will be inconsistent with that of unaffected shards. This feature can be useful to experiment with adding/removing (ideally non-unique) indexes.
{{< /warning >}}

### Launching a postponed migration

Launching a postponed-launch migration is achieved by the following commands:

```sql
mysql> alter vitess_migration '9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3' launch;
```

The above unblocks the specific migration on all shards. The migration will execute at the discretion of the Online DDL executor.

```sql
mysql> alter vitess_migration '9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3' launch vitess_shards '-40,40-80';
```

This variation accepts a comma delimited list of shard names. The migration will only launch on the specified shards. the rest of the shards ignore the command. An empty list of shards lets the command run on all shards.

```sql
mysql> alter vitess_migration launch all;
```

Launches all currently postponed migrations on all shards.

Postponed launch is supported for all migrations.

## Postpone completion

A common requirement by engineers is to have more control over the cut-over time. With postponed completion migrations, it is possible to:

- Invoke a migration that postpones completion
- Manually `COMPLETE` a migration

This lets an engineer observe the change of schema at a point when they're comfortably at their console and prepared to take action should any issue occur.

Add `--postpone-completion` to any* (see [supported migrations](#supported-migrations)) of the online DDL strategies. Example:

```sql

mysql> set @@ddl_strategy='vitess --postpone-completion';

-- The migration is tracked, but the table won't get created
mysql> create table mytable(id int primary key);
+--------------------------------------+
| uuid                                 |
+--------------------------------------+
| a1dac193_4b86_11ec_a827_0a43f95f28a3 |
+--------------------------------------+
```

Migrations executed with `--postpone-completion` are visible on `show vitess_migrations` just as normal. They will present either as `queued`, `ready` or `running`, at the scheduler's discretion. But they will not actually make changes to affected tables. The column `postpone_completion` indicates that the migration will not auto-complete:

```sql
mysql> show vitess_migrations like 'a1dac193_4b86_11ec_a827_0a43f95f28a3' \G

                             id: 1

### Completing a postponed migration

Completing a postponed-completion migration is achieved by:

```sql
mysql> alter vitess_migration 'b7d6e6fb_8a74_11eb_badd_f875a4d24e90' complete;
```

This command instructs Vitess that the migration should not kept waiting any further.
{{< info >}}
The command serves as a hint. It does not synchronously cut-over the migration. It is possible that the migration is not yet ready to cut-over (e.g. a long running `ALTER` may not be done copying all necessary data)
{{< /info >}}

After issuing the command, value of `postpone_completion` turns to `0`:

```sql
mysql> show vitess_migrations like '3091ef2a_4b87_11ec_a827_0a43f95f28a3' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                             id: 3
                 migration_uuid: 3091ef2a_4b87_11ec_a827_0a43f95f28a3
...
                       strategy: vitess
                        options: --postpone-completion
                added_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:27:34
            requested_timestamp: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
                ready_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:27:35
              started_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:27:35
             liveness_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:29:32
            completed_timestamp: NULL
              cleanup_timestamp: NULL
               migration_status: running
                            ...
            postpone_completion: 0
```

In the above the migration is still `running`. The scheduler has not determined yet that it is ready to cut-over. Continuing the example, two seconds later:
```sql
mysql> show vitess_migrations like '3091ef2a_4b87_11ec_a827_0a43f95f28a3' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                             id: 3
                 migration_uuid: 3091ef2a_4b87_11ec_a827_0a43f95f28a3
                            ...
                       strategy: vitess
                        options: --postpone-completion
                added_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:27:34
            requested_timestamp: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
                ready_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:27:35
              started_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:27:35
             liveness_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:29:32
            completed_timestamp: 2021-11-22 11:29:33
              cleanup_timestamp: NULL
               migration_status: complete
...
            postpone_completion: 0
```

### Supported migrations

Postponed completion is supported for:

- `CREATE` and `DROP` for all online strategies
- `ALTER` migrations in `vitess` (formerly known as `online`) strategy
- `ALTER` migrations in `gh-ost` strategy
- `REVERT` of any of the above, as well as further cascading `REVERT` operations

Postponed completion is not supported in:

- `direct` strategy
- `pt-osc` for `ALTER` migrations

[declarative migrations](../declarative-migrations) will remain `queued` when `-postpone-migration` is specified, until `alter vitess_migration ... complete` is issued. This is true whether the declarative migration implies an eventual `CREATE`, `DROP` or `ALTER`.

### Implementation details

The two strong cases for postponed migrations are `DROP` and log `ALTER`s. Both carry an amount of risk to production above other migrations.

Postponed `ALTER` migrations (in `vitess` and `gh-ost` strategies) are actually executed, and begin copying table data as well as track ongoing changes. But as they reach the point where cut-over is agreeable, they stall, and keep waiting until the user issues the `alter vitess_migration ... complete` statement. Assuming the user runs the statement when all data has already been copied, it is typically a matter of seconds until the migration completes and the new schema is instated.

For `CREATE` and `DROP` statements, there's no such backfill process as with `ALTER`, and the migrations are simply not scheduled, until the user issues the `complete` statement. Once the statement is issued, the migrations still need to be scheduled, and may be possibly delayed by an existing queue of migrations.

## Mixing postponed launch and completion

You may use both `--postpone-launch --postpone-completion` for a migration. For example, if you wanted to just see how long it takes to run a migration on a single shard and what impact it makes, but then only cut-over with all other shards, you would:


```sql

mysql> set @@ddl_strategy='vitess --postpone-launch --postpone-completion';

-- The migration is tracked, but the ALTER process won't start running.
mysql> alter table mytable add column i int not null;
+--------------------------------------+
| uuid                                 |
+--------------------------------------+
| 9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3 |
+--------------------------------------+

mysql> alter vitess_migration '9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3' launch vitess_shards '-40';
```

You'd then wait until `ready_to_complete` to be `1` for that specific shard, at which time you'll have gathered all your data. You'd then:

```sql
mysql> alter vitess_migration launch all;
```

Next, you'd wait for _all_ shard to reach `ready_to_complete`, at which time you'd cut-over all of them:


```sql
mysql> alter vitess_migration complete all;
```
