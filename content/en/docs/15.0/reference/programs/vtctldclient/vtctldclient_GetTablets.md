## vtctldclient GetTablets

Looks up tablets according to filter criteria.

### Synopsis

Looks up tablets according to the filter criteria.

If --tablet-alias is passed, none of the other filters (keyspace, shard, cell) may
be passed, and tablets are looked up by tablet alias only.

If --keyspace is passed, then all tablets in the keyspace are retrieved. The
--shard flag may also be passed to further narrow the set of tablets to that
<keyspace/shard>. Passing --shard without also passing --keyspace will fail.

Passing --cell limits the set of tablets to those in the specified cells. The
--cell flag accepts a CSV argument (e.g. --cell "c1,c2") and may be repeated
(e.g. --cell "c1" --cell "c2").

Valid output formats are "awk" and "json".

```
vtctldclient GetTablets [--strict] [{--cell $c1 [--cell $c2 ...], --keyspace $ks [--shard $shard], --tablet-alias $alias}]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --cell strings           List of cells to filter tablets by.
      --format string          Output format to use; valid choices are (json, awk). (default "awk")
  -h, --help                   help for GetTablets
  -k, --keyspace string        Keyspace to filter tablets by.
  -s, --shard string           Shard to filter tablets by.
      --strict                 Require all cells to return successful tablet data. Without --strict, tablet listings may be partial.
  -t, --tablet-alias strings   List of tablet aliases to filter by.
```
