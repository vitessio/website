The following has been verified to work on __CentOS 7__. If you are new to Vitess, it is recommended to start with the [local install](../../get-started/local) guide instead.

## Install Dependencies

### Install Go 1.17+

[Download and install](http://golang.org/doc/install) Golang 1.17. For example, at writing:

```
curl -LO https://golang.org/dl/go1.17.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Make sure to add go to your bashrc:
```
# Additions to ~/.bashrc file

# Add go PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# Add GOROOT
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go/

# Add GOPATH
export GOPATH=/home/<user>/go
```

### Packages from CentOS repos

First install the MySQL 5.7 repository from Oracle:

```
sudo yum localinstall -y https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-9.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install -y mysql-community-server
```

Install additional dependencies required to build and run Vitess:

```
sudo yum install -y make unzip g++ etcd curl git wget
```

**Notes:**

* We will be using etcd as the topology service. The command `make tools` can also install Zookeeper or Consul for you, which requires additional dependencies.
* Vitess currently has some additional tests written in Python, but we will be skipping this step for simplicity.

### Disable SELinux

SELinux will not allow Vitess to launch MySQL in any data directory by default. You will need to disable it:

```
sudo setenforce 0
```

## Build Vitess

Navigate to the directory where you want to download the Vitess source code and clone the Vitess GitHub repo:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/vitessio/vitess.git
cd vitess
```

Set environment variables that Vitess will require. It is recommended to put these in your `.bashrc`:

```
# Additions to ~/.bashrc file

#VTDATAROOT
export VTDATAROOT=/tmp/vtdataroot

# Vitess binaries
export PATH=~/vitess/bin:${PATH}
```

Build Vitess:

```
make build
```

## Testing your Binaries

The unit tests require the following additional packages:

```
sudo yum install -y ant maven zip gcc
```

You can then install additional components from `make tools`. If your machine requires a proxy to access the Internet, you will need to set the usual environment variables (e.g. `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`) first:

```
make tools
make unit_test
```

In addition to running tests, you can try running the [local example](../../get-started/local).

## Common Build Issues

### Key Already Exists

This error is because etcd was not cleaned up from the previous run of the example. You can manually fix this by running `./401_teardown.sh`, removing vtdataroot and then starting again:
```
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/zone1) [6]
Error:  105: Key already exists (/vitess/global) [6]
```

### MySQL Fails to Initialize

This error is most likely the result of SELinux enabled:

```
