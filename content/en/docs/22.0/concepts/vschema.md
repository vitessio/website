title: VSchema
---

A [VSchema](../../reference/features/vschema) allows you to describe how data is organized within keyspaces and shards. This information is used for routing queries, and also during resharding operations.

For a Keyspace, you can specify if it's sharded or not. For sharded keyspaces, you can specify the list of vindexes for each table.

Vitess also supports [sequence generators](../../reference/features/vitess-sequences/) that can be used to generate new ids that work like MySQL auto increment columns. The VSchema allows you to associate table columns to sequence tables. If no value is specified for such a column, then VTGate will know to use the sequence table to generate a new value for it.
