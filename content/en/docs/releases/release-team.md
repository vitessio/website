The release team changes for each [release cycle](release-cycle).
A team remains the same for the entire lifecycle of a major release.
Below is a table that describes how the team is composed.

|      Role       | Definition                                                                                       |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Release Lead   | Leads the release and its activity.                                                              |
|     Shadow      | Follows the release lead and learns. Will become the release lead during the next release cycle. |
|     Mentor      | Previous release lead, is here to assist the current release lead and shadow.                    |
