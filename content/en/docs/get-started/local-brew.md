This guide covers installing Vitess locally to macOS for testing purposes, from pre-compiled binaries. We will launch multiple copies of `mysqld`, so it is recommended to have greater than 4GB RAM, as well as 20GB of available disk space.

A [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager is also available, which requires no dependencies on your local host.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Install Vitess with Homebrew

Vitess supports MySQL 5.7+ and MariaDB 10.3+. Homebrew will install latest tagged Vitess Release.

```bash
$ brew install vitess

## Start a Single Keyspace Cluster

For testing purposes initiate following example;
```bash
$ cd /usr/local/share/vitess/examples/local/
$ ./101_initial_cluster.sh
add /vitess/global
add /vitess/zone1
add zone1 CellInfo

Verify your initial cluster:
```sql

+-------+----------+-------+------------+---------+------------------+-----------+----------------------+
| Cell  | Keyspace | Shard | TabletType | State   | Alias            | Hostname  | MasterTermStartTime  |

+-------+----------+-------+------------+---------+------------------+-----------+----------------------+
```
You can also verify that the processes have started with `pgrep`:

```bash
$ pgrep -fl vtdataroot | awk '{print $2,$3}'
etcd --enable-v2=true
vtctld -topo_implementation
/bin/sh /usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysqld_safe
/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/Cellar/vitess/9.0.0/share/vitess/examples/local/vtdataroot/vt_0000000100/my.cnf
vttablet -topo_implementation
/bin/sh /usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysqld_safe
/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/Cellar/vitess/9.0.0/share/vitess/examples/local/vtdataroot/vt_0000000101/my.cnf
vttablet -topo_implementation
/bin/sh /usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysqld_safe
/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/Cellar/vitess/9.0.0/share/vitess/examples/local/vtdataroot/vt_0000000102/my.cnf
vttablet -topo_implementation
vtgate -topo_implementation
```

_The exact list of processes will vary. For example, you may not see `mysqld_safe` listed._

If you encounter any errors, such as ports already in use, you can kill the processes and start over:

```bash
pkill -9 -f '(vtdataroot|VTDATAROOT)' # kill Vitess processes
rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar/vitess/9.0.0/share/vitess/examples/local/vtdataroot
```

## Setup Aliases

For ease-of-use, Vitess provides aliases for `mysql` and `vtctlclient`:

```bash
source ./env.sh
```

Setting up aliases changes `mysql` to always connect to Vitess for your current session. To revert this, type `unalias mysql && unalias vtctlclient` or close your session.

## Connect to your cluster

You should now be able to connect to the VTGate server that was started in `101_initial_cluster.sh`:

```bash
/usr/local/share/vitess/examples/local> mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 2

mysql> show tables;
+-----------------------+
| Tables_in_vt_commerce |
+-----------------------+

| customer              |

```

You can also browse to the vtctld console using the following URL:

```text

```

## Summary

In this example, we deployed a single unsharded keyspace named `commerce`. Unsharded keyspaces have a single shard named `0`. The following schema reflects a common ecommerce scenario that was created by the script:

```sql
create table product (
  sku varbinary(128),
  description varbinary(128),
  price bigint,
  primary key(sku)
);
create table customer (
  customer_id bigint not null auto_increment,
  email varbinary(128),
  primary key(customer_id)
);
create table corder (
  order_id bigint not null auto_increment,
  customer_id bigint,
  sku varbinary(128),
  price bigint,
  primary key(order_id)
);
```

The schema has been simplified to include only those fields that are significant to the example:

* The `product` table contains the product information for all of the products.
* The `customer` table has a `customer_id` that has an `auto_increment`. A typical customer table would have a lot more columns, and sometimes additional detail tables.
* The `corder` table (named so because `order` is an SQL reserved word) has an `order_id` auto-increment column. It also has foreign keys into `customer(customer_id)` and `product(sku)`.

## Next Steps

You can now proceed with [MoveTables](../../user-guides/migration/move-tables).

Or alternatively, if you would like to teardown your example:

```bash
pkill -9 -f '(vtdataroot|VTDATAROOT)' # kill Vitess processes
rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar/vitess/9.0.0/share/vitess/examples/local/vtdataroot
```
