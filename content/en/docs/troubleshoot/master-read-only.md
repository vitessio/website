## Master starts up read-only

To prevent accidentally accepting writes, our default my.cnf settings tell MySQL to always start up read-only. If the master MySQL gets restarted, it will thus come back read-only until you intervene to confirm that it should accept writes. You can use the [`SetReadWrite`](../reference/programs/vtctl/#setreadwrite) command to do that.

However, usually if something unexpected happens to the master, it's better to reparent to a different replica with [`EmergencyReparentShard`](../reference/programs/vtctl/#emergencyreparentshard). If you need to do planned maintenance on the master, it's best to first reparent to another replica with [`PlannedReparentShard`](../reference/programs/vtctl/#plannedreparentshard).
