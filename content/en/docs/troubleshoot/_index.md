If there is a problem in the system, one or many alerts would typically fire. If a problem was found through means other than an alert, then the alert system needs to be iterated upon.

When an alert fires, you have the following sources of information to perform your investigation:

* Alert values
* Graphs
* Diagnostic URLs
* Log files

### Find Vitess build running
