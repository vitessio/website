{{< info >}}
This documentation is for a new (v2) set of vtctld commands that start in Vitess 11.0. See [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/7225) for more details.
{{< /info >}}

### Command

```
MoveTables [-source=<sourceKs>] [-tables=<tableSpecs>] [-cells=<cells>]
  [-tablet_types=<source_tablet_types>] [-all] [-exclude=<tables>]
   [-auto_start] [-stop_after_copy]
  Create <targetKs.workflow>

Reshard [-source_shards=<source_shards>] [-target_shards=<target_shards>]
  [-cells=<cells>] [-tablet_types=<source_tablet_types>]  [-skip_schema_copy]
  Create <keyspace.workflow>

```

### Description

`MoveTables/Reshard Create` sets up and creates a new workflow. The workflow name should not conflict with that of an existing workflow.

### Parameters

#### -source
**mandatory**

**MoveTables only**
<div class="cmd">
Name of existing keyspace (the source keyspace) that contains the tables to be moved.
</div>

#### table_specs
**mandatory**  Either `table_specs` or `-all` needs to be specified

**MoveTables only**
<div class="cmd">
_Either_

* a comma-separated list of tables
  * if target keyspace is unsharded OR
  * if target keyspace is sharded AND the tables being moved are already defined in the target's vschema

  Example: `MoveTables -source=commerce -tables=customer,corder Create customer.commerce2customer`

_Or_

* the JSON table section of the vschema for associated tables
  * if target keyspace is sharded AND
  * tables being moved are not yet present in the target's vschema

  Example: `MoveTables -source=commerce -tables='{"t1":{"column_vindexes": [{"column": "id", "name": "hash"}]}}}' Create customer.commerce2customer`

</div>

#### -cells
**optional**\
**default** local cell

<div class="cmd">
A comma-separated list of cell names or cell aliases. This list is used by VReplication to determine which
cells should be used to pick a tablet for selecting data from the source keyspace.<br><br>

###### Uses

* Improve performance by picking a tablet in cells in network proximity with the target
* Reduce bandwidth costs by skipping cells that are in different availability zones
* Select cells where replica lags are lower
</div>

#### -tablet_types
**optional**\
**default** replica

<div class="cmd">
A comma-separated list of tablet types that are used while picking a tablet for sourcing data. One or more from PRIMARY, REPLICA, RDONLY.<br><br>

###### Uses

* To reduce the load on PRIMARY tablets by using REPLICAs or RDONLYs
* Reducing lag by pointing to PRIMARY
</div>


#### -auto_start

**optional**
**default** true

<div class="cmd">

Normally the workflow starts immediately after it is created. If this flag is set
to false then the workflow is in a Stopped state until you explicitly start it.

</div>

###### Uses

* Allows updating the rows in `_vt.vreplication` after MoveTables has setup the
streams. For example, you can add some filters to specific tables or change the
projection clause to modify the values on the target. This
provides an easier way to create simpler Materialize workflows by first using
MoveTables with auto_start false, updating the BinlogSource as required by your
Materialize and then starting the workflow.
* Changing the `copy_state` and/or `pos` values to restart a broken MoveTables workflow
from a specific point of time.

#### -stop_after_copy

**optional**
**default** false

<div class="cmd">

If set, the workflow will stop once the Copy phase has been completed i.e. once
all tables have been copied and VReplication decides that the lag
is small enough to start replicating, the workflow state will be set to Stopped.

###### Uses
* If you just want a consistent snapshot of all the tables you can set this flag. The workflow
will stop once the copy is done and you can then mark the workflow as `Complete`d

</div>

#### -all
**optional** cannot specify `table_specs` if `-all` is specified

**MoveTables only**
<div class="cmd">

Move all tables from the source keyspace.

</div>

#### -exclude
**optional** only applies if `-all` is specified

**MoveTables only**
<div class="cmd">

If moving all tables, specifies tables to be skipped.

</div>


#### source_shards
**mandatory**

**Reshard only**

<div class="cmd">
Comma-separated shard names to reshard from.

Example: `Reshard -source_shards=0 -target_shards=-80,80- Create customer.reshard1to2`

</div>

#### target_shards
**mandatory**

**Reshard only**

<div class="cmd">
Comma-separated shard names to reshard to.
</div>

#### -skip_schema_copy
**optional**\
**default** false

**Reshard only**

<div class="cmd">
If true the source schema is copied to the target shards. If false, you need to create the tables
before calling `Reshard`.
</div>
