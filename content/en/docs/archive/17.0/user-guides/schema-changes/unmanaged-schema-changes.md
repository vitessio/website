Vitess offers multiple approaches to running unmanaged schema changes. Below, we review each of these approaches.

We assume we have a keyspace (schema) called `commerce`, with a table called `demo`, that has the following definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `demo` (
  `id` int NOT NULL,
  `status` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB
```

## ApplySchema

`ApplySchema` is a `vtctlclient` command that can be used to apply a schema change to a keyspace. The main advantage of using this tool is that it performs some sanity checks about the schema before applying it. However, a downside is that it can be a little too strict and may not work for all use cases.

Consider the following examples:

```shell
$ vtctlclient ApplySchema -- --sql "ALTER TABLE demo modify id bigint unsigned" commerce
```
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE demo;


CREATE TABLE `demo` (
  `id` bigint unsigned NOT NULL,
  `status` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB
```
In the above, we run a direct, synchronous, blocking `ALTER TABLE` statement. Knowing the table is in `commerce` keyspace, Vitess autodetects the relevant shards, and then autodetects which is the `primary` server in each shard. It then directly invokes the `ALTER TABLE` statement on all shards (concurrently), and the `vtctlclient` command only returns when all are complete.

Vitess will run some validations:

```shell
$ vtctlclient ApplySchema -- --sql "ALTER TABLE demo add column status int" commerce
E0908 10:35:53.478462 3711762 main.go:67] remote error: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = schema change failed, ExecuteResult: {
  "FailedShards": null,
  "SuccessShards": null,
  "CurSQLIndex": 0,
  "Sqls": [
    "ALTER TABLE demo add column status int"
  ],
  "ExecutorErr": "rpc error: code = Unknown desc = TabletManager.PreflightSchema on zone1-0000000100 error: /usr/bin/mysql: exit status 1, output: ERROR 1060 (42S21) at line 3: Duplicate column name 'status'\n: /usr/bin/mysql: exit status 1, output: ERROR 1060 (42S21) at line 3: Duplicate column name 'status'\n",
  "TotalTimeSpent": 87104194
}
```

Vitess was able to determine that the migration is invalid because a column named `status` already exists. The statement never made it to the MySQL servers. These checks are not thorough, though they cover common scenarios.

If the table is large, then `ApplySchema` will reject the statement, try to protect the user from blocking their production servers. You may override that by supplying `--allow_long_unavailability` as follows:

```shell
$ vtctlclient ApplySchema -- --allow_long_unavailability --sql "ALTER TABLE demo modify id bigint unsigned" commerce
```


## VTGate

You may run DDL directly from VTGate just like you would send to a MySQL instance. For example:

```shell
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 15306 commerce
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

mysql> ALTER TABLE demo ADD COLUMN sample INT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
```

Just like in the previous example, Vitess will find out what the affected shards are, what the identity is of each shard's `primary`, then invoke the statement on all shards.

You may apply the change to specific shards by connecting directly to those shards:

```shell
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 15306 commerce/-80
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

mysql> ALTER TABLE demo ADD COLUMN sample INT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
```

In the above we connect to VTGate via the `mysql` command line client, but of course you may connect with any standard MySQL client or from your application.

Please do note that if VTGate does not recognize a DDL syntax, the statement will get rejected and that this approach is not recommended for changing large tables.

## Directly to MySQL

You can apply schema changes directly to the underlying MySQL shard primary instances. 

VTTablet will eventually notice the change and update itself. This is controlled by the `--queryserver-config-schema-reload-time` parameter which defaults to 1800 seconds.

You can also explicitly issue the `vtctlclient` `ReloadSchema` command to make it reload immediately. Specify a tablet to reload the schema from, as in:

```shell
$ vtctlclient ReloadSchema zone1-0000000100
```

Users will likely want to deploy schema changes via [managed, online schema changes](../managed-online-schema-changes/) where the table is not locked in the duration of the migration.
