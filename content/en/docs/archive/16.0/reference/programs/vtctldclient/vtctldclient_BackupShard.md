## vtctldclient BackupShard

Finds the most up-to-date REPLICA, RDONLY, or SPARE tablet in the given shard and uses the BackupStorage service on that tablet to create and store a new backup.

### Synopsis

Finds the most up-to-date REPLICA, RDONLY, or SPARE tablet in the given shard and uses the BackupStorage service on that tablet to create and store a new backup.

If no replica-type tablet can be found, the backup can be taken on the primary if --allow-primary is specified.

```
vtctldclient BackupShard [--concurrency <concurrency>] [--allow-primary] <keyspace/shard>
```

### Options

```
      --allow-primary      Allow the primary of a shard to be used for the backup. WARNING: If using the builtin backup engine, this will shutdown mysqld on the primary and stop writes for the duration of the backup.
      --concurrency uint   Specifies the number of compression/checksum jobs to run simultaneously. (default 4)
  -h, --help               help for BackupShard
```

```
      --action_timeout duration   timeout for the total command (default 1h0m0s)
      --server string             server to use for connection (required)
