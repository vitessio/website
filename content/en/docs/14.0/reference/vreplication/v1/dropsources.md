{{< info >}}
Starting with Vitess 11.0 you should use the [VReplication v2 commands](../../complete)
{{< /info >}}

### Command

```
DropSources -- [--dry_run] [--rename_tables] [--keep_data] <keyspace.workflow>
```

### Description

Once SwitchWrites has been run DropSources cleans up the source resources by deleting the
source tables for a MoveTables workflow or source shards for a Reshard workflow. It also
cleans up other artifacts of the workflow, deleting forward and reverse replication streams and
blacklisted tables.

***Warning***: This command actually deletes data. We recommend that you run this
with the --dry_run parameter first and reads its output so that you know which actions will be performed.

### Parameters

#### --rename_tables
**optional**\
**default** all

<div class="cmd">
Only applies for a MoveTables workflow. Instead of deleting the tables in the source it renames them
using the template _&lt;tableName&gt;_old, the same scheme followed by pt-osc
</div>

#### --dry-run
**optional**\
**default** false

<div class="cmd">
You can do a dry run where no actual action is taken but the command logs all the actions that would be taken
by SwitchReads.
</div>

#### --keep_data
**optional**\
**default** false

<div class="cmd">

Usually, the source data (tables or shards) are deleted by Complete. If this flag is used, for MoveTables, source tables will not be deleted, for Reshard, source shards will not be dropped.

</div>

#### keyspace.workflow
**mandatory**

<div class="cmd">
Name of target keyspace and the associated workflow to run VDiff on.
</div>
