title: vtctld
description: The Vitess Admin GUI
---

`vtctld` is a webserver interface to administer a Vitess cluster. It is usually the first Vitess component to be started after a valid global topology service has been created.

## Example Usage

The following example launches the `vtctld` daemon on port 15000:

```bash
export TOPOLOGY_FLAGS="-topo_implementation etcd2 -topo_global_server_address localhost:2379 -topo_global_root /vitess/global"
export VTDATAROOT="/tmp"

vtctld \
 $TOPOLOGY_FLAGS \
 -workflow_manager_init \
 -workflow_manager_use_election \
 -service_map 'grpc-vtctl' \
 -backup_storage_implementation file \
 -file_backup_storage_root $VTDATAROOT/backups \
 -log_dir $VTDATAROOT/tmp \
 -port 15000 \
 -grpc_port 15999
```
