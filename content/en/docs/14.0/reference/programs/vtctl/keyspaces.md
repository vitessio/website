The following `vtctl` commands are available for administering Keyspaces.

## Commands

### CreateKeyspace

Creates the specified keyspace.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">CreateKeyspace [-sharding_column_name=name] [-sharding_column_type=type] [-served_from=tablettype1:ks1,tablettype2,ks2,...] [-force] &lt;keyspace name&gt;
Creates the specified keyspace. keyspace_type can be NORMAL or SNAPSHOT. For a SNAPSHOT keyspace you must specify the name of a base_keyspace, and a snapshot_time in UTC, in RFC3339 time format, e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05+00:00</pre>

#### Flags

| Name | Type | Definition |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| force | Boolean | Proceeds even if the keyspace already exists |
| served_from | string | Specifies a comma-separated list of dbtype:keyspace pairs used to serve traffic |
| sharding_column_name | string | Specifies the column to use for sharding operations |
| sharding_column_type | string | Specifies the type of the column to use for sharding operations |


#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace name&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables. Vitess distributes keyspace shards into multiple machines and provides an SQL interface to query the data. The argument value must be a string that does not contain whitespace.

#### Errors

* the <code>&lt;keyspace name&gt;</code> argument is required for the <code>&lt;CreateKeyspace&gt;</code> command This error occurs if the command is not called with exactly one argument.

### DeleteKeyspace

Deletes the specified keyspace. In recursive mode, it also recursively deletes all shards in the keyspace. Otherwise, there must be no shards left in the keyspace.

#### Example

<pre class="command-example">DeleteKeyspace [-recursive] &lt;keyspace&gt;
Deletes the specified keyspace. In recursive mode, it also recursively deletes all shards in the keyspace. Otherwise, there must be no shards left in the keyspace.</pre>

| recursive | Boolean | Also recursively delete all shards in the keyspace. |


#### Arguments

* <code>&lt;keyspace&gt;</code> &ndash; Required. The name of a sharded database that contains one or more tables. Vitess distributes keyspace shards into multiple machines and provides an SQL interface to query the data. The argument value must be a string that does not contain whitespace.

Reshard  -v1 [-skip_schema_copy] <keyspace.workflow> <source_shards> <target_shards>
Start a Resharding process. Example: Reshard -cells='zone1,alias1' -tablet_types='primary,replica,rdonly'  ks.workflow001 '0' '-80,80-'.
```
#### Notes

* The <code>v1</code> argument is required in Vitess 11.0 and later
* This command is part of the [VReplication v1 workflow](../../../vreplication/v1) -- we recommend that you use the [v2 workflow](../../../vreplication/reshard) in Vitess 11.0 and later

### Reshard (v2)

```shell
Reshard <options> <action> <workflow identifier>
```

### MoveTables (v1)

```shell
MoveTables  -v1 [-cell=<cell>] [-tablet_types=<source_tablet_types>] -workflow=<workflow> <source_keyspace> <target_keyspace> <table_specs>
Move table(s) to another keyspace, table_specs is a list of tables or the tables section of the vschema for the target keyspace. Example: '{"t1":{"column_vindexes": [{"column": "id1", "name": "hash"}]}, "t2":{"column_vindexes": [{"column": "id2", "name": "hash"}]}}'.  In the case of an unsharded target keyspace the vschema for each table may be empty. Example: '{"t1":{}, "t2":{}}'.
```
#### Notes

* The <code>v1</code> argument is required in Vitess 11.0 and later
* This command is part of the [VReplication v1 workflow](../../../vreplication/v1) -- we recommend that you use the [v2 workflow](../../../vreplication/movetables) in Vitess 11.0 and later

## MoveTables (v2)

```shell
MoveTables <options> <action> <workflow identifier>
```

### DropSources

```shell
DropSources  [-dry_run] [-rename_tables] <keyspace.workflow>
After a MoveTables or Resharding workflow cleanup unused artifacts like source tables, source shards and blacklists.
```

#### Notes

### CreateLookupVindex

```shell
CreateLookupVindex  [-cells=<source_cells>] [-continue_after_copy_with_owner=false] [-tablet_types=<source_tablet_types>] <keyspace> <json_spec>

```

### ExternalizeVindex

```shell
ExternalizeVindex  <keyspace>.<vindex>
Externalize (activate) a lookup vindex backfilled using `CreateLookupVindex`.
This removes the workflow and vreplication streams associated with the
backfill, and clears the `write_only` flag on the vindex. After this flag is
removed, applications can start using the vindex for lookups.
```

### Materialize

```shell
Materialize  <json_spec>, example : '{"workflow": "aaa", "source_keyspace": "source", "target_keyspace": "target", "table_settings": [{"target_table": "customer", "source_expression": "select * from customer", "create_ddl": "copy"}]}'
