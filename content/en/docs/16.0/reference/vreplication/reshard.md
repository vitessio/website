{{< warning >}}
These workflows can have a significant impact on the source tablets (which are often in production) â€” especially when a PRIMARY tablet is used as a source. You can limit the impact on the source tablets using the [`--vreplication_copy_phase_max_*` vttablet flags](../flags/#vreplication_copy_phase_max_innodb_history_list_length)
{{< /warning >}}

## Command

```
Reshard <options> <action> <workflow identifier>
```

or

```
Reshard -- [--source_shards=<source_shards>] [--target_shards=<target_shards>] [--cells=<cells>]
           [--tablet_types=<source_tablet_types>] [--skip_schema_copy] [--auto_start]
           [--stop_after_copy] [--on-ddl=<ddl-action>] [--timeout=timeoutDuration]
           [--reverse_replication] [--keep_data] [--keep_routing_rules] <action> <keyspace.workflow>
```

## Description

Reshard is used to create and manage workflows to horizontally shard an existing keyspace. The source keyspace can be unsharded or sharded.

## Parameters

### action

<div class="cmd">

Reshard is an "umbrella" command. The `action` sub-command defines the operation on the workflow.
Action must be one of the following: Create, Complete, Cancel, SwitchTraffic, ReverseTrafffic, Show, or Progress

</div>

### options
<div class="cmd">

Each `action` has additional options/parameters that can be used to modify its behavior.

`actions` are common to both `MoveTables` and `Reshard` workflows. Only the `create` action has different parameters, all other actions have common options and similar semantics. These actions are documented separately.

</div>

#### source_shards
**mandatory**

<div class="cmd">
Comma separated shard names to reshard from.
</div>

#### target_shards
**mandatory**

<div class="cmd">
Comma separated shard names to reshard to.
</div>

#### --cells
**optional**\
**default** local cell

<div class="cmd">
Comma separated list of Cell(s) and/or CellAlias(es) to replicate from.
</div>

#### --tablet_types 
**optional**\
**default** `--vreplication_tablet_type` parameter value for the tablet. `--vreplication_tablet_type` has the default value of "in_order:REPLICA,PRIMARY".\
**string**

<div class="cmd">

Source tablet types to replicate from (e.g. PRIMARY, REPLICA, RDONLY). Defaults to --vreplication_tablet_type parameter value for the tablet, which has the default value of "in_order:REPLICA,PRIMARY".

</div>

#### --skip_schema_copy
**optional**\
**default** false

<div class="cmd">
If false, the source schema is copied to the target shards. If true, the schema won't be copied
and you need to create the tables on the new target shards before creating the Reshard workflow.
</div>

#### --auto_start

**optional**
**default** true

<div class="cmd">

Normally the workflow starts immediately after it is created. If this flag is set
to false then the workflow is in a Stopped state until you explicitly start it.

</div>

###### Uses
* allows updating the rows in `_vt.vreplication` after `Reshard` has setup the
streams. For example, you can add some filters to specific tables or change the
projection clause to modify the values on the target. This
provides an easier way to create simpler `Materialize` workflows by first using
`Reshard` with `--auto_start false`, updating the BinlogSource as required by your
`Materialize` and then start the workflow.
* changing the `copy_state` and/or `pos` values to restart a broken `Reshard` workflow
from a specific point of time.

#### --stop_after_copy

**optional**
**default** false

<div class="cmd">

If set, the workflow will stop once the Copy phase has been completed i.e. once
all tables have been copied and VReplication decides that the lag
is small enough to start replicating, the workflow state will be set to Stopped.

###### Uses
* If you just want a consistent snapshot of all the tables you can set this flag. The workflow
will stop once the copy is done and you can then mark the workflow as `Complete`d

</div>

#### --timeout
**optional**\
**default** 30s

<div class="cmd">

For primary tablets, SwitchTraffic first stops writes on the source primary and waits for the replication to the target to
catchup with the point where the writes were stopped. If the wait time is longer than timeout
the command will error out. For setups with high write qps you may need to increase this value.

</div>

#### --reverse_replication
**optional**\
**default** true

<div class="cmd">

SwitchTraffic for primary tablet types, by default, starts a reverse replication stream with the current target as the source, replicating back to the original source. This enables a quick and simple rollback using ReverseTraffic. This reverse workflow name is that of the original workflow concatenated with \_reverse.

If set to false these reverse replication streams will not be created and you will not be able to rollback once you have switched write traffic over to the target.

</div>

#### --keep_data
**optional**\
**default** false

<div class="cmd">

Usually, the target shards are dropped by `Cancel`. If this flag is used the target shards will not be dropped.

</div>

#### --keep_routing_rules
**optional**\
**default** false

<div class="cmd">

Usually, any routing rules created by the workflow in the source and target keyspace are removed by `Complete` or `Cancel`. If this flag is used the routing rules will be left in place.

</div>

#### --on-ddl
**optional**\
**default** IGNORE

<div class="cmd">

This flag allows you to specify what to do with DDL SQL statements when they are encountered
in the replication stream from the source. The values can be as follows:

* `IGNORE`: Ignore all DDLs (this is also the default, if a value for `on-ddl`
  is not provided).
* `STOP`: Stop when DDL is encountered. This allows you to make any necessary
  changes to the target. Once changes are made, updating the workflow state to
  `Running` will cause VReplication to continue from just after the point where
  it encountered the DDL. Alternatively you may want to `Cancel` the workflow
  and create a new one to fully resync with the source.
* `EXEC`: Apply the DDL, but stop if an error is encountered while applying it.
* `EXEC_IGNORE`: Apply the DDL, but ignore any errors and continue replicating.

{{< warning >}}
We caution against against using `EXEC` or `EXEC_IGNORE` for the following reasons:
  * You may want a different schema on the target.
  * You may want to apply the DDL in a different way on the target.
  * The DDL may take a long time to apply on the target and may disrupt replication, performance, and query execution (if serving  traffic from the target) while it is being applied.
{{< /warning >}}

</div>

#### workflow identifier

<div class="cmd">

All workflows are identified by `targetKeyspace.workflow` where `targetKeyspace` is the name of the keyspace to which the tables are being moved. `workflow` is a name you assign to the `Reshard` workflow to identify it.

</div>


### The most basic Reshard Workflow lifecycle

1. Initiate the migration using [Create](../create)<br/>
`Reshard -- --source_shards=<source_shards> --target_shards=<target_shards> Create <keyspace.workflow>`
1. Monitor the workflow using [Show](../show) or [Progress](../progress)<br/>
`Reshard Show <keyspace.workflow>` _*or*_ <br/>
`Reshard Progress <keyspace.workflow>`<br/>
1. Confirm that data has been copied over correctly using [VDiff](../vdiff)
1. Cutover to the target keyspace with [SwitchTraffic](../switchtraffic) <br/>
`Reshard SwitchTraffic <keyspace.workflow>`
1. Cleanup vreplication artifacts and source shards with [Complete](../complete) <br/>
`Reshard Complete <keyspace.workflow>`
