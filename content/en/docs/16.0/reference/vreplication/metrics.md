VReplication exports several metrics using the expvars interface. These are available at the `debug/vars` endpoint of vttablet's http status pages. [More details here](../../features/monitoring/#3-push-based-metrics-system#3-push-based-metrics-system)

## Target Metrics

#### VReplicationCopyLoopCount, VReplicationCopyLoopCountTotal

During the copy phase we run one loop of bulk copy for approximately an hour at a time before running catchup. _VReplicationCopyLoopCount_ counts the number of times this loop has run for each stream and _VReplicationCopyLoopCountTotal_ the total across all streams.

#### VReplicationCopyRowCount, VReplicationCopyRowCountTotal

_VReplicationCopyRowCount_ counts the number of rows copied during the copy phase per stream and _VReplicationCopyRowCountTotal_ the total across all streams.

#### VReplicationErrors

_VReplicationErrors_ counts the number of times errors occurred during vreplication. Errors are keyed
with the type of error.

#### VReplicationHeartbeat

_VReplicationHeartbeat_ records, for each stream, the timestamp sent by the last heartbeat event for that stream.

#### VReplicationMessages

_VReplicationMessages_ contains a stack of the last N (currently 3) messages of a vreplication stream.

#### VReplicationMessages

_VReplicationMessages_ contains a stack of the last N (currently 3) messages of a vreplication stream.

#### VReplicationPhaseTimings, VReplicationPhaseTimingsCounts, VReplicationPhaseTimingsTotal

This metric relates to the times each phase is run during the lifetime of a stream.
_VReplicationPhaseTimings_ counts the total time taken by the runs,
VReplicationPhaseTimingsCounts the number of runs and _VReplicationPhaseTimingsTotals_ the total
runs across all streams.

#### VReplicationTableCopyRowCounts

_VReplicationTableCopyRowCounts_ counts the number of rows copied during the copy phase per table per stream.

#### VReplicationTableCopyTimings

_VReplicationTableCopyTimings_ counts the time taken per table per stream during the copy phase of the stream. Unlike _VReplicationPhaseTimings_, this metric updates continuously, rather than being set once at the end of the copy phase.

#### VReplicationQPS

_VReplicationQPS_ is a list of QPS values for each loop of each phase of the workflow.

#### VReplicationQueryCount, VReplicationQueryCountTotal

_VReplicationQueryCount_ is the total number of queries in each phase of a workflow. _VReplicationQueryCountTotal_ is the total queries across all phases and workflows.

#### VReplicationSecondsBehindMaster, VReplicationSecondsBehindMasterMax, VReplicationSecondsBehindMasterTotal

Deprecated. See next section.

#### VReplicationLagSeconds, VReplicationLagSecondsMax, VReplicationLagSecondsTotal

These metrics show the replication lag of the target stream with respect to the source stream. _VReplicationLagSeconds_ shows the current replication lag and _VReplicationLagSecondsMax_ has the maximum lag in this stream. Note that these values are only valid during the replication phase of a workflow.

#### VReplicationSource

Shows the keyspace and shard of the source from which this target stream is replicating

#### VReplicationSourceTablet

Shows the tablet from which this stream is currently replicating

#### VReplicationStreamCount

The number of streams running on this target

#### VReplicationStreamState

This shows the state of each stream.

## Source Metrics

#### VStreamPacketSize

The value of the `vstream_packet_size` flag specified for this tablet

#### VStreamerCount

The current number of running vstreamers

#### VStreamerErrors

The number of errors per category across workflows

#### VStreamersEndedWithErrors

The total number of errors that caused a stream to stall

#### VStreamerEventsStreamed

The total number of events streamed by this vttablet across all workflows

#### VStreamerNumPackets

The total number of packets sent by this vttablet across all workflows

#### VStreamersCreated

The total number of vstreamer created during the lifetime of this tablet
