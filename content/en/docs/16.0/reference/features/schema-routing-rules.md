The Vitess routing rules feature is a powerful mechanism for directing query traffic to the right keyspaces, shards, and tablet types.
Their primary usage today is for the following use case:

* **Routing traffic during data migrations**: during e.g. [`MoveTables`](../../vreplication/movetables/) and
  [`Reshard`](../../vreplication/reshard/) operations, routing rules dictate where to send reads and writes. These routing rules are managed
  automatically by VReplication. You can see an example of their usage in the [MoveTables](../../../user-guides/migration/move-tables/) user guide.

Understanding the routing rules can help you debug migration related issues as well as provide you with another powerful tool as
you operate Vitess.

## Viewing Routing Rules

The routing rules are global and can be viewed using the [`GetRoutingRules` client command](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_getroutingrules/).

## Updating Routing Rules

You can update the routing rules using the [`ApplyRoutingRules` client command](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_applyroutingrules/).

## Syntax

Routing rules are managed using the JSON format. Here's an example, using the routing rules that are put in place by `MoveTables`
in the [local examples](../../../get-started/local/) where the `customer` and `corder` tables are being moved from the `commerce`
keyspace to the `customer` keyspace and we have not yet switched traffic from the `commerce` keyspace to the `customer` keyspace â€” so all
traffic, regardless of which keyspace a client uses, are sent to the `commerce` keyspace:
