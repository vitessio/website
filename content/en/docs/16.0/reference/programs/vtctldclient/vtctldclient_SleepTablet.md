## vtctldclient SleepTablet

Blocks the action queue on the specified tablet for the specified amount of time. This is typically used for testing.

### Synopsis

SleepTablet <alias> <duration>

Blocks the action queue on the specified tablet for the specified duration.
This command is typically only used for testing.
		
The duration is the amount of time that the action queue should be blocked.
The value is a string that contains a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers,
each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as “300ms” or “1h45m”.
See the definition of the Go language’s ParseDuration[1] function for more details.
Note that, in the SleepTablet implementation, the value should be positively-signed.
