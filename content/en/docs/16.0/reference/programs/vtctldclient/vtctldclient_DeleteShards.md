## vtctldclient DeleteShards

Deletes the specified shards from the topology.

### Synopsis

Deletes the specified shards from the topology.

In recursive mode, it also deletes all tablets belonging to the shard.
Otherwise, the shard must be empty (have no tablets) or returns an error for
that shard.

```
vtctldclient DeleteShards [--recursive|-r] [--even-if-serving] [--force|-f] <keyspace/shard> [<keyspace/shard> ...]
```

### Options

```
      --even-if-serving   Remove the shard even if it is serving. Use with caution.
  -f, --force             Remove the shard even if it cannot be locked; this should only be used for cleanup operations.
  -h, --help              help for DeleteShards
  -r, --recursive         Also delete all tablets belonging to the shard. This is required to delete a non-empty shard.
```
