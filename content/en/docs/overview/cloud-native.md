Vitess is well-suited for Cloud deployments because it enables databases to incrementally add capacity. The easiest way to run Vitess is via Kubernetes.

## Vitess on Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source orchestration system for Docker containers, and Vitess can run as a Kubernetes-aware cloud native distributed database.

Kubernetes handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster, actively manages workloads on those nodes, and groups containers comprising an application for easy management and discovery. This provides an analogous open-source environment to the way Vitess runs in YouTube, on the predecessor to Kubernetes.
