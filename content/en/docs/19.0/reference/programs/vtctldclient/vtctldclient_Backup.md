## vtctldclient Backup

Uses the BackupStorage service on the given tablet to create and store a new backup.

```
vtctldclient Backup [--concurrency <concurrency>] [--allow-primary] [--incremental-from-pos=<pos>|<backup-name>|auto] [--upgrade-safe] <tablet_alias>
```

### Options

```
      --allow-primary                 Allow the primary of a shard to be used for the backup. WARNING: If using the builtin backup engine, this will shutdown mysqld on the primary and stop writes for the duration of the backup.
      --concurrency int32             Specifies the number of compression/checksum jobs to run simultaneously. (default 4)
  -h, --help                          help for Backup
      --incremental-from-pos string   Position, or name of backup from which to create an incremental backup. Default: empty. If given, then this backup becomes an incremental backup from given position or given backup. If value is 'auto', backup taken from last successful backup position.
      --upgrade-safe                  Whether to use innodb_fast_shutdown=0 for the backup so it is safe to use for MySQL upgrades.
```
