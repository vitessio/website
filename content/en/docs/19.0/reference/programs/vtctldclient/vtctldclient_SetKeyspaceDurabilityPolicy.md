## vtctldclient SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy

Sets the durability-policy used by the specified keyspace.

Sets the durability-policy used by the specified keyspace. 
Durability policy governs the durability of the keyspace by describing which tablets should be sending semi-sync acknowledgements to the primary.
Possible values include 'semi_sync', 'none' and others as dictated by registered plugins.

SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy --durability-policy='semi_sync' customer

```
vtctldclient SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy [--durability-policy=policy_name] <keyspace name>
```
