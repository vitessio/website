That means we've accomplished all our planned overhauls of client APIs and backward-incompatible protocol changes. See the [release notes](https://github.com/youtube/vitess/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.1) for what's new.  

We're now working closely with several users who are evaluating Vitess and providing feedback on the use cases that are important for their particular applications and production environments. If you're at the same stage, we welcome you to join the discussion by posting on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vitess).  

We're also trying out [Slack](https://vitess.slack.com/) for more conversational topics. We don't have an automatic invite system in place, so please email <vitess@googlegroups.com> to request an invite if you're interested in joining the channel.  

Lastly, we're starting our own blog (seeded with our previous guest posts on other blogs). This will be a place for our engineers to go more in-depth into various parts of Vitess.  

Thanks, and happy scaling everyone!
