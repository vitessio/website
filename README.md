# The Vitess website (THE MOST AMAZING WEBSITE)

This repo houses is the assets used to build the website at https://vitess.io.

> **NOTE**: This repo uses `prod` as the default branch rather than the usual `master`. Make sure to rebase against the `prod` branch if you have existing work branched from `master`. See [issue #210](https://github.com/vitessio/website/issues/210) for an explanation of why this was done.

## Running the site locally

To run the website locally, you need to have the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator installed in your device (installation instructions [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)). Once Hugo is installed run the following:

```bash
hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture
```

This starts Hugo in local mode. You can see access the site at http://localhost:1313.

You will also need to either:

- install `npm` and run `npm install` or,
- install and run `yarn`

## Adding a user logo

If you'd like to add your logo to the [Who uses Vitess](https://vitess.io/#who-uses) section of the website, add a PNG, JPEG, or SVG of your logo to the [`static/img/logos/users`](./static/img/logos/users) directory in this repo and submit a pull request with your change. Name the image file something that reflects your company (e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image `acme.png`).

## Link checking

You can check the site's internal links by running `make check-internal-links` and all links—internal *and* external—by running `make check-all-links`.
