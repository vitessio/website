# The Vitess website

This repo houses the assets used to build the website at https://vitess.io.

> **NOTE**: This repo uses `prod` as the default branch rather than the usual `master`. Make sure to rebase against the `prod` branch if you have existing work branched from `master`.

## Adding a user logo

If you'd like to add your logo to the [Who uses Vitess](https://vitess.io/#who-uses) section of the website, add a PNG, JPEG, or SVG of your logo to the [`static/img/logos/users`](./static/img/logos/users) directory in this repo and submit a pull request with your change. Name the image file something that reflects your company (e.g. if your company is called Acme name the image `acme.png`).
